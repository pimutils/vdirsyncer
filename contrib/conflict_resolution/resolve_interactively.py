"""Ask user to resolve a vdirsyncer sync conflict interactively.

Needs a way to ask the user.
The use of https://apps.kde.org/kdialog/ for GNU/Linix is hardcoded.

Depends on python>3.5 and KDialog.

Usage:
  Ensure the file executable and use it in the vdirsyncer.conf file, e.g.

  conflict_resolution = ["command", "/home/bern/vdirsyncer/resolve_interactively.py"]
