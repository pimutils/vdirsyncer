    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    There are storage classes which control the access to one vdir-collection
    and offer basic CRUD-ish methods for modifying those collections. The exact
    interface is described in `vdirsyncer.storage.base`, the `Storage` class
    should be a superclass of all storage classes.
