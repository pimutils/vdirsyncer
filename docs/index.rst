Vdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two storages.
The most popular purpose is to synchronize CalDAV and CardDAV with a local
folder or file. The local data can then be :doc:`accessed via a variety of
programs <supported>`, none of which have to know or worry about syncing to a
server.

It aims to be for CalDAV and CardDAV what `OfflineIMAP
<http://offlineimap.org/>`_ is for IMAP.
