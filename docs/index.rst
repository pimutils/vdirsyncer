Vdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two
:ref:`storages <storages>`. The most popular purpose is to synchronize a
CalDAV/CardDAV server with a local folder or file. The local data can then be
accessed via a variety of :doc:`programs <supported>`, none of which have to
know or worry about syncing to a server.

It aims to be for CalDAV and CardDAV what `OfflineIMAP
<http://offlineimap.org/>`_ is for IMAP.
