Supported Software
==================

Client applications
===================

The following software has been reported to work well with vdirsyncer, however,
none of it is regularly tested.

Calendars
---------

- khal_, a CLI calendar application supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`. You can use
  :storage:`filesystem` with it.

- Many graphical calendar apps such as dayplanner_, Orage_ or rainlendar_ save
  a calendar in a single ``.ics`` file. You can use :storage:`singlefile` with
  those.

.. _Orage: http://www.kolumbus.fi/~w408237/orage/
.. _rainlendar: http://www.rainlendar.net/

Task/Todo managers
------------------

The iCalendar format also supports saving tasks in form of ``VTODO``-entries,
with the same file extension as normal events: ``.ics``. All CalDAV servers
support synchronizing tasks, vdirsyncer does too.

- todoman_, a CLI task manager supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`.  You can use
  :storage:`filesystem` with it.

  Its interface is similar to the ones of Taskwarrior or the todo.txt CLI app
  and should be intuitively usable.

Contacts
--------

- khard_, a commandline addressbook supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`.  You can use
  :storage:`filesystem` with it.

- contactquery.c_, a small program explicitly written for querying vdirs from
  mutt.

- mates_, a commandline addressbook supporting :doc:`vdir <vdir>`.

Supported servers
=================

CalDAV and CardDAV servers not listed here may work anyway.

Radicale
--------

Radicale_ is a very lightweight server, however, it intentionally doesn't
implement the CalDAV and CardDAV standards completely, which might lead to
issues even with very well-written clients. Apart from its non-conformity with
standards, there are multiple other problems with its code quality and the way
it is maintained.

That said, vdirsyncer is continuously tested against the git version and the
latest PyPI release of Radicale.

- Vdirsyncer can't create collections on Radicale.
- Radicale doesn't `support time ranges in the calendar-query of CalDAV
  <https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/issues/146>`_, so setting ``start_date``
  and ``end_date`` for :storage:`caldav` will have no or unpredicted
  consequences.

- `Versions of Radicale older than 0.9b1 choke on RFC-conform queries for all
  items of a collection <https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/issues/143>`_.

  You have to set ``item_types = ["VTODO", "VEVENT"]`` in
  :storage:`caldav` for vdirsyncer to work with those versions.

.. _owncloud_setup:

ownCloud
--------

Vdirsyncer is continuously tested against the latest version of ownCloud_::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/caldav/
    username = ...
    password = ...

    [storage card]
    type = carddav
    url = https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/carddav/
    username = ...
    password = ...

- *Versions older than 7.0.0:* ownCloud uses SabreDAV, which had problems
  detecting collisions and race-conditions. The problems were reported and are
  fixed in SabreDAV's repo, and the corresponding fix is also in ownCloud since
  7.0.0. See :gh:`16` for more information.

FastMail
--------

Vdirsyncer is irregularly tested against FastMail_. There are no known issues
with it. `FastMail's support pages
<https://www.fastmail.com/help/technical/servernamesandports.html>`_ provide
the settings to use::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://caldav.messagingengine.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

    [storage card]
    type = carddav
    url = https://carddav.messagingengine.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

.. _FastMail: https://www.fastmail.com/

.. _icloud_setup:

iCloud
------

Vdirsyncer is irregularly tested against iCloud_.

::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://caldav.icloud.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

    [storage card]
    type = carddav
    url = https://contacts.icloud.com/
    username = ...
    password = ...

Problems:

- Vdirsyncer can't do two-factor auth with iCloud (there doesn't seem to be a
  way to do two-factor auth over the DAV APIs) You'll need to use `app-specific
  passwords <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397>`_ instead.
- Vdirsyncer can't create collections on iCloud.

.. _iCloud: https://www.icloud.com/

.. _davmail_setup:

DavMail (Exchange, Outlook)
---------------------------

Using vdirsyncer with DavMail_ is possible, but you might get confronted with
weird errors coming from old Exchange servers, malformed calendar entries with
special characters and/or using an old DavMail version.

**Make absolutely sure you use the latest DavMail**::

    [storage outlook]
    type = caldav
    url = http://localhost:1080/
    username = user@example.com
    password = ...

- Older versions of DavMail handle URLs case-insensitively. See :gh:`144`.
- DavMail is handling old broken events very poorly. In such cases the
  `Calendar Checking Tool for Outlook
  <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28786>`_ might
  help.

If you encounter any problems, do report them to me, but it's probably not
vdirsyncer's fault.

Baikal
------

Vdirsyncer is continuously tested against the latest version of Baikal_.

- Baikal up to ``0.2.7`` also uses an old version of SabreDAV, with the same
  issue as ownCloud, see :gh:`160`. This issue is fixed in later versions.

.. _Baikal: http://baikal-server.com/

Google
------

Using vdirsyncer with Google Calendar is possible, but it is not tested
frequently.

::

    [storage cal]
    type = caldav
    url = https://apidata.googleusercontent.com/caldav/v2/
    auth = oauth2_google

    [storage card]
    type = carddav
    url = https://www.googleapis.com/carddav/v1/principals/EMAIL/lists/default
    auth = oauth2_google

At first run you will be asked to authorize application for google account
access. Simply follow the instructions. You'll be asked to modify configuration
file (save `refresh_token` as a password).

- Google's CardDav implementation is very limited, may lead to data loss, use
  with care.
- You can select which calendars to sync on
  `CalDav settings page <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect>`_

For more information see :gh:`202` and :gh:`8`.
