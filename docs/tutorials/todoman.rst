The iCalendar format also supports saving tasks in form of ``VTODO``-entries,
with the same file extension as normal events: ``.ics``. Many CalDAV servers
support synchronizing tasks, vdirsyncer does too.

todoman_ is a CLI task manager supporting :doc:`vdir </vdir>`. Its interface is
similar to the ones of Taskwarrior or the todo.txt CLI app. You can use
:storage:`filesystem` with it.
