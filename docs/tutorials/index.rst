Other tutorials
===============

The following section contains tutorials not explicitly about any particular
core function of vdirsyncer. They usually show how to integrate vdirsyncer with
third-party software. Because of that, it may be that the information regarding
that other software only applies to specific versions of them.

.. note::
    Please :doc:`contribute </contributing>` your own tutorials too!  Pages are
    often only stubs and are lacking full examples.

Further applications, with missing pages:

- khal_, a CLI calendar application supporting :doc:`vdir </vdir>`. You can use
  :storage:`filesystem` with it.
- Many graphical calendar apps such as dayplanner_, Orage_ or rainlendar_ save
  a calendar in a single ``.ics`` file. You can use :storage:`singlefile` with
  those.
- khard_, a commandline addressbook supporting :doc:`vdir </vdir>`.  You can use
  :storage:`filesystem` with it.
- contactquery.c_, a small program explicitly written for querying vdirs from
  mutt.

- vdirel_, access :doc:`vdir </vdir>` contacts from Emacs.
