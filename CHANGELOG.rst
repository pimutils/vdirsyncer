Version 0.4.1
=============

*yet to be released*

- All ``create`` arguments from all storages are gone. Vdirsyncer now asks if
  it should try to create collections.

Version 0.4.0
=============

*released on 31 December 2014*

- The ``passwordeval`` parameter has been renamed to ``password_command``.
- The old way of writing certain config values such as lists is now gone.
- Collection discovery has been rewritten. Old configuration files should be
  compatible with it, but vdirsyncer now caches the results of the collection
  discovery. You have to run ``vdirsyncer discover`` if collections were added
  or removed on one side.
- Pair and storage names are now restricted to certain characters. Vdirsyncer
  will issue a clear error message if your configuration file is invalid in
  that regard.
- Vdirsyncer now supports the XDG-Basedir specification. If the
  ``VDIRSYNCER_CONFIG`` environment variable isn't set and the
  ``~/.vdirsyncer/config`` file doesn't exist, it will look for the
  configuration file at ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vdirsyncer/config``.
- Some improvements to CardDAV and CalDAV discovery, based on problems found
  with FastMail. Support for ``.well-known``-URIs has been added.

Version 0.3.4
=============

*released on 8 December 2014*

- Some more bugfixes to config handling.

Version 0.3.3
=============

*released on 8 December 2014*

- Vdirsyncer now also works with iCloud. Particularly collection discovery and
  etag handling were fixed.
- Vdirsyncer now encodes Cal- and CardDAV requests differently. This hasn't
  been well-tested with servers like Zimbra or SoGo, but isn't expected to
  cause any problems.
- Vdirsyncer is now more robust regarding invalid responses from CalDAV
  servers. This should help with future compatibility with Davmail/Outlook.
- Fix a bug when specifying ``item_types`` of
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CaldavStorage` in the deprecated config format.
- Fix a bug where vdirsyncer would ignore all but one character specified in
  ``unsafe_href_chars`` of :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CaldavStorage` and
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CarddavStorage`.

Version 0.3.2
=============

*released on 3 December 2014*

- The current config format has been deprecated, and support for it will be
  removed in version 0.4.0. Vdirsyncer warns about this now.

Version 0.3.1
=============

*released on 24 November 2014*

- Fixed a bug where vdirsyncer would delete items if they're deleted on side A
  but modified on side B. Instead vdirsyncer will now upload the new items to
  side A. See :gh:`128`.

- Synchronization continues with the remaining pairs if one pair crashes, see
  :gh:`121`.

- The ``processes`` config key is gone. There is now a ``--max-workers`` option
  on the CLI which has a similar purpose. See :ghpr:`126`.

- The Read The Docs-theme is no longer required for building the docs. If it is
  not installed, the default theme will be used. See :gh:`134`.

Version 0.3.0
=============

*released on 20 September 2014*

- Add ``verify_fingerprint`` parameter to
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.HttpStorage`,
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CaldavStorage` and
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CarddavStorage`,
  see :gh:`99` and :ghpr:`106`.

- Add ``passwordeval`` parameter to :ref:`general_config`, see :gh:`108` and
  :ghpr:`117`.

- Emit warnings (instead of exceptions) about certain invalid responses from
  the server, see :gh:`113`.  This is apparently required for compatibility
  with Davmail.

Version 0.2.5
=============

*released on 27 August 2014*

- Don't ask for the password of one server more than once and fix multiple
  concurrency issues, see :gh:`101`.

- Better validation of DAV endpoints.

Version 0.2.4
=============

*released on 18 August 2014*

- Include workaround for collection discovery with latest version of Radicale.

- Include metadata files such as the changelog or license in source
  distribution, see :gh:`97` and :gh:`98`.

Version 0.2.3
=============

*released on 11 August 2014*

- Vdirsyncer now has a ``--version`` flag, see :gh:`92`.

- Fix a lot of bugs related to special characters in URLs, see :gh:`49`.

Version 0.2.2
=============

*released on 04 August 2014*

- Remove a security check that caused problems with special characters in DAV
  URLs and certain servers. On top of that, the security check was nonsensical.
  See :gh:`87` and :gh:`91`.

- Change some errors to warnings, see :gh:`88`.

- Improve collection autodiscovery for servers without full support.

Version 0.2.1
=============

*released on 05 July 2014*

- Fix bug where vdirsyncer shows empty addressbooks when using CardDAV with
  Zimbra.

- Fix infinite loop when password doesn't exist in system keyring.

- Colorized errors, warnings and debug messages.

- vdirsyncer now depends on the ``click`` package instead of argvard.

Version 0.2.0
=============

*released on 12 June 2014*

- vdirsyncer now depends on the ``icalendar`` package from PyPI, to get rid of
  its own broken parser.

- vdirsyncer now also depends on ``requests_toolbelt``. This makes it possible
  to guess the authentication type instead of blankly assuming ``basic``.

- Fix a semi-bug in caldav and carddav storages where a tuple (href, etag)
  instead of the proper etag would have been returned from the upload method.
  vdirsyncer might do unnecessary copying when upgrading to this version.

- Add the storage :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.SingleFileStorage`. See
  :gh:`48`.

- The ``collections`` parameter for pair sections now accepts the special
  values ``from a`` and ``from b`` for automatically discovering collections.
  See :ref:`pair_config`.

- The ``read_only`` parameter was added to storage sections. See
  :ref:`storage_config`.

Version 0.1.5
=============

*released on 14 May 2014*

- Introduced changelogs

- Many bugfixes

- Many doc fixes

- vdirsyncer now doesn't necessarily need UIDs anymore for synchronization.

- vdirsyncer now aborts if one collection got completely emptied between
  synchronizations. See :gh:`42`.
