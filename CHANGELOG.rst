Version 0.15
============

- Deprecated syntax for configuration values is now completely rejected. All
  values now have to be valid JSON.
- A few UX improvements for Google storages, see :gh:`549` and :gh:`552`.
- Conflict resolution commands now get path-expanded, i.e. "~/bin/myresolver"
  is now acceptable, whereas before one had to specify the absolute path
  including the home directory, see :gh:`563`.

Version 0.14.1
==============

*released on 05 January 2017*

- ``vdirsyncer repair`` no longer changes "unsafe" UIDs by default, an extra
  option has to be specified. See :gh:`527`.
- A lot of important documentation updates.

Version 0.14.0
==============

*released on 26 October 2016*

- ``vdirsyncer sync`` now continues other uploads if one upload failed.  The
  exit code in such situations is still non-zero.
- Add ``partial_sync`` option to pair section. See :ref:`the config docs
  <partial_sync_def>`.
- Vdirsyner will now warn if there's a string without quotes in your config.
  Please file issues if you find documentation that uses unquoted strings.
- Fix an issue that would break khal's config setup wizard.

Version 0.13.1
==============

*released on 30 September 2016*

- Fix a bug that would completely break collection discovery.

Version 0.13.0
==============

*released on 29 September 2016*

- Python 2 is no longer supported at all. See :gh:`219`.
- Config sections are now checked for duplicate names. This also means that you
  cannot have a storage section ``[storage foo]`` and a pair ``[pair foo]`` in
  your config, they have to have different names. This is done such that
  console output is always unambigous. See :gh:`459`.
- Custom commands can now be used for conflict resolution during sync. See
  :gh:`127`.
- :storage:`http` now completely ignores UIDs. This avoids a lot of unnecessary
  down- and uploads.

Version 0.12.1
==============

*released on 20 August 2016*

- Fix a crash for Google and DAV storages. See :ghpr:`492`.
- Fix an URL-encoding problem with DavMail. See :gh:`491`.

Version 0.12
============

*released on 19 August 2016*

- :storage:`singlefile` now supports collections. See :ghpr:`488`.

Version 0.11.3
==============

*released on 29 July 2016*

- Default value of ``auth`` parameter was changed from ``guess`` to ``basic``
  to resolve issues with the Apple Calendar Server (:gh:`457`) and improve
  performance. See :gh:`461`.
- **Packagers:** The ``click-threading`` requirement is now ``>=0.2``. It was
  incorrect before. See :gh:`478`.
- Fix a bug in the DAV XML parsing code that would make vdirsyncer crash on
  certain input. See :gh:`480`.
- Redirect chains should now be properly handled when resolving ``well-known``
  URLs. See :ghpr:`481`.

Version 0.11.2
==============

*released on 15 June 2016*

- Fix typo that would break tests.

Version 0.11.1
==============

*released on 15 June 2016*

- Fix a bug in collection validation.
- Fix a cosmetic bug in debug output.
- Various documentation improvements.

Version 0.11.0
==============

*released on 19 May 2016*

- Discovery is no longer automatically done when running ``vdirsyncer sync``.
  ``vdirsyncer discover`` now has to be explicitly called.
- Add a ``.plist`` example for Mac OS X.
- Usage under Python 2 now requires a special config parameter to be set.
- Various deprecated configuration parameters do no longer have specialized
  errormessages. The generic error message for unknown parameters is shown.

  - Vdirsyncer no longer warns that the ``passwordeval`` parameter has been
    renamed to ``password_command``.

  - The ``keyring`` fetching strategy has been dropped some versions ago, but
    the specialized error message has been dropped.

  - A old status format from version 0.4 is no longer supported. If you're
    experiencing problems, just delete your status folder.

Version 0.10.0
==============

*released on 23 April 2016*

- New storage types :storage:`google_calendar` and :storage:`google_contacts`
  have been added.
- New global command line option `--config`, to specify an alternative config
  file. See :gh:`409`.
- The ``collections`` parameter can now be used to synchronize
  differently-named collections with each other.
- **Packagers:** The ``lxml`` dependency has been dropped.
- XML parsing is now a lot stricter. Malfunctioning servers that used to work
  with vdirsyncer may stop working.

Version 0.9.3
=============

*released on 22 March 2016*

- :storage:`singlefile` and :storage:`http` now handle recurring events
  properly.
- Fix a typo in the packaging guidelines.
- Moved to ``pimutils`` organization on GitHub. Old links *should* redirect,
  but be aware of client software that doesn't properly handle redirects.

Version 0.9.2
=============

*released on 13 March 2016*

- Fixed testsuite for environments that don't have any web browser installed.
  See :ghpr:`384`.

Version 0.9.1
=============

*released on 13 March 2016*

- Removed leftover debug print statement in ``vdirsyncer discover``, see commit
  ``3d856749f37639821b148238ef35f1acba82db36``.

- ``metasync`` will now strip whitespace from the start and the end of the
  values. See :gh:`358`.

- New ``Packaging Guidelines`` have been added to the documentation.

Version 0.9.0
=============

*released on 15 February 2016*

- The ``collections`` parameter is now required in pair configurations.
  Vdirsyncer will tell you what to do in its error message. See :gh:`328`.

Version 0.8.1
=============

*released on 30 January 2016*

- Fix error messages when invalid parameter fetching strategy is used. This is
  important because users would receive awkward errors for using deprecated
  ``keyring`` fetching.

Version 0.8.0
=============

*released on 27 January 2016*

- Keyring support has been removed, which means that ``password.fetch =
  ["keyring", "example.com", "myuser"]`` doesn't work anymore.

  For existing setups: Use ``password.fetch = ["command", "keyring", "get",
  "example.com", "myuser"]`` instead, which is more generic. See the
  documentation for details.

- Now emitting a warning when running under Python 2. See :gh:`219`.

Version 0.7.5
=============

*released on 23 December 2015*

- Fixed a bug in :storage:`remotestorage` that would try to open a CLI browser
  for OAuth.
- Fix a packaging bug that would prevent vdirsyncer from working with newer
  lxml versions.

Version 0.7.4
=============

*released on 22 December 2015*

- Improved error messages instead of faulty server behavior, see :gh:`290` and
  :gh:`300`.
- Safer shutdown of threadpool, avoid exceptions, see :gh:`291`.
- Fix a sync bug for read-only storages see commmit
  ``ed22764921b2e5bf6a934cf14aa9c5fede804d8e``.
- Etag changes are no longer sufficient to trigger sync operations. An actual
  content change is also necessary. See :gh:`257`.
- :storage:`remotestorage` now automatically opens authentication dialogs in
  your configured GUI browser.
- **Packagers:** ``lxml>=3.1`` is now required (newer lower-bound version).

Version 0.7.3
=============

*released on 05 November 2015*

- Make remotestorage-dependencies actually optional.

Version 0.7.2
=============

*released on 05 November 2015*

- Un-break testsuite.

Version 0.7.1
=============

*released on 05 November 2015*

- **Packagers:** The setuptools extras ``keyring`` and ``remotestorage`` have
  been added. They're basically optional dependencies. See ``setup.py`` for
  more details.

- Highly experimental remoteStorage support has been added. It may be
  completely overhauled or even removed in any version.

- Removed mentions of old ``password_command`` in documentation.

Version 0.7.0
=============

*released on 27 October 2015*

- **Packagers:** New dependencies are ``click_threading``, ``click_log`` and
  ``click>=5.0``.
- ``password_command`` is gone. Keyring support got completely overhauled. See
  :doc:`keyring`.

Version 0.6.0
=============

*released on 06 August 2015*

- ``password_command`` invocations with non-zero exit code are now fatal (and
  will abort synchronization) instead of just producing a warning.
- Vdirsyncer is now able to synchronize metadata of collections. Set ``metadata
  = ["displayname"]`` and run ``vdirsyncer metasync``.
- **Packagers:** Don't use the GitHub tarballs, but the PyPI ones.
- **Packagers:** ``build.sh`` is gone, and ``Makefile`` is included in
  tarballs. See the content of ``Makefile`` on how to run tests post-packaging.
- ``verify_fingerprint`` doesn't automatically disable ``verify`` anymore.

Version 0.5.2
=============

*released on 15 June 2015*

- Vdirsyncer now checks and corrects the permissions of status files.
- Vdirsyncer is now more robust towards changing UIDs inside items.
- Vdirsyncer is now handling unicode hrefs and UIDs correctly. Software that
  produces non-ASCII UIDs is broken, but apparently it exists.

Version 0.5.1
=============

*released on 29 May 2015*

- **N.b.: The PyPI upload of 0.5.0 is completely broken.**
- Raise version of required requests-toolbelt to ``0.4.0``.
- Command line should be a lot faster when no work is done, e.g. for help
  output.
- Fix compatibility with iCloud again.
- Use only one worker if debug mode is activated.
- ``verify=false`` is now disallowed in vdirsyncer, please use
  ``verify_fingerprint`` instead.
- Fixed a bug where vdirsyncer's DAV storage was not using the configured
  useragent for collection discovery.

Version 0.4.4
=============

*released on 12 March 2015*

- Support for client certificates via the new ``auth_cert``
  parameter, see :gh:`182` and :ghpr:`183`.
- The ``icalendar`` package is no longer required.
- Several bugfixes related to collection creation.

Version 0.4.3
=============

*released on 20 February 2015*

- More performance improvements to ``singlefile``-storage.
- Add ``post_hook`` param to ``filesystem``-storage.
- Collection creation now also works with SabreDAV-based servers, such as
  Baikal or ownCloud.
- Removed some workarounds for Radicale. Upgrading to the latest Radicale will
  fix the issues.
- Fixed issues with iCloud discovery.
- Vdirsyncer now includes a simple ``repair`` command that seeks to fix some
  broken items.

Version 0.4.2
=============

*released on 30 January 2015*

- Vdirsyncer now respects redirects when uploading and updating items. This
  might fix issues with Zimbra.
- Relative ``status_path`` values are now interpreted as relative to the
  configuration file's directory.
- Fixed compatibility with custom SabreDAV servers. See :gh:`166`.
- Catch harmless threading exceptions that occur when shutting down vdirsyncer.
  See :gh:`167`.
- Vdirsyncer now depends on ``atomicwrites``.
- Massive performance improvements to ``singlefile``-storage.
- Items with extremely long UIDs should now be saved properly in
  ``filesystem``-storage. See :gh:`173`.

Version 0.4.1
=============

*released on 05 January 2015*

- All ``create`` arguments from all storages are gone. Vdirsyncer now asks if
  it should try to create collections.
- The old config values ``True``, ``False``, ``on``, ``off`` and ``None`` are
  now invalid.
- UID conflicts are now properly handled instead of ignoring one item. Card-
  and CalDAV servers are already supposed to take care of those though.
- Official Baikal support added.

Version 0.4.0
=============

*released on 31 December 2014*

- The ``passwordeval`` parameter has been renamed to ``password_command``.
- The old way of writing certain config values such as lists is now gone.
- Collection discovery has been rewritten. Old configuration files should be
  compatible with it, but vdirsyncer now caches the results of the collection
  discovery. You have to run ``vdirsyncer discover`` if collections were added
  or removed on one side.
- Pair and storage names are now restricted to certain characters. Vdirsyncer
  will issue a clear error message if your configuration file is invalid in
  that regard.
- Vdirsyncer now supports the XDG-Basedir specification. If the
  ``VDIRSYNCER_CONFIG`` environment variable isn't set and the
  ``~/.vdirsyncer/config`` file doesn't exist, it will look for the
  configuration file at ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vdirsyncer/config``.
- Some improvements to CardDAV and CalDAV discovery, based on problems found
  with FastMail. Support for ``.well-known``-URIs has been added.

Version 0.3.4
=============

*released on 8 December 2014*

- Some more bugfixes to config handling.

Version 0.3.3
=============

*released on 8 December 2014*

- Vdirsyncer now also works with iCloud. Particularly collection discovery and
  etag handling were fixed.
- Vdirsyncer now encodes Cal- and CardDAV requests differently. This hasn't
  been well-tested with servers like Zimbra or SoGo, but isn't expected to
  cause any problems.
- Vdirsyncer is now more robust regarding invalid responses from CalDAV
  servers. This should help with future compatibility with Davmail/Outlook.
- Fix a bug when specifying ``item_types`` of :storage:`caldav` in the
  deprecated config format.
- Fix a bug where vdirsyncer would ignore all but one character specified in
  ``unsafe_href_chars`` of :storage:`caldav` and :storage:`carddav`.

Version 0.3.2
=============

*released on 3 December 2014*

- The current config format has been deprecated, and support for it will be
  removed in version 0.4.0. Vdirsyncer warns about this now.

Version 0.3.1
=============

*released on 24 November 2014*

- Fixed a bug where vdirsyncer would delete items if they're deleted on side A
  but modified on side B. Instead vdirsyncer will now upload the new items to
  side A. See :gh:`128`.

- Synchronization continues with the remaining pairs if one pair crashes, see
  :gh:`121`.

- The ``processes`` config key is gone. There is now a ``--max-workers`` option
  on the CLI which has a similar purpose. See :ghpr:`126`.

- The Read The Docs-theme is no longer required for building the docs. If it is
  not installed, the default theme will be used. See :gh:`134`.

Version 0.3.0
=============

*released on 20 September 2014*

- Add ``verify_fingerprint`` parameter to :storage:`http`, :storage:`caldav`
  and :storage:`carddav`, see :gh:`99` and :ghpr:`106`.

- Add ``passwordeval`` parameter to :ref:`general_config`, see :gh:`108` and
  :ghpr:`117`.

- Emit warnings (instead of exceptions) about certain invalid responses from
  the server, see :gh:`113`.  This is apparently required for compatibility
  with Davmail.

Version 0.2.5
=============

*released on 27 August 2014*

- Don't ask for the password of one server more than once and fix multiple
  concurrency issues, see :gh:`101`.

- Better validation of DAV endpoints.

Version 0.2.4
=============

*released on 18 August 2014*

- Include workaround for collection discovery with latest version of Radicale.

- Include metadata files such as the changelog or license in source
  distribution, see :gh:`97` and :gh:`98`.

Version 0.2.3
=============

*released on 11 August 2014*

- Vdirsyncer now has a ``--version`` flag, see :gh:`92`.

- Fix a lot of bugs related to special characters in URLs, see :gh:`49`.

Version 0.2.2
=============

*released on 04 August 2014*

- Remove a security check that caused problems with special characters in DAV
  URLs and certain servers. On top of that, the security check was nonsensical.
  See :gh:`87` and :gh:`91`.

- Change some errors to warnings, see :gh:`88`.

- Improve collection autodiscovery for servers without full support.

Version 0.2.1
=============

*released on 05 July 2014*

- Fix bug where vdirsyncer shows empty addressbooks when using CardDAV with
  Zimbra.

- Fix infinite loop when password doesn't exist in system keyring.

- Colorized errors, warnings and debug messages.

- vdirsyncer now depends on the ``click`` package instead of argvard.

Version 0.2.0
=============

*released on 12 June 2014*

- vdirsyncer now depends on the ``icalendar`` package from PyPI, to get rid of
  its own broken parser.

- vdirsyncer now also depends on ``requests_toolbelt``. This makes it possible
  to guess the authentication type instead of blankly assuming ``basic``.

- Fix a semi-bug in caldav and carddav storages where a tuple (href, etag)
  instead of the proper etag would have been returned from the upload method.
  vdirsyncer might do unnecessary copying when upgrading to this version.

- Add the storage :storage:`singlefile`. See :gh:`48`.

- The ``collections`` parameter for pair sections now accepts the special
  values ``from a`` and ``from b`` for automatically discovering collections.
  See :ref:`pair_config`.

- The ``read_only`` parameter was added to storage sections. See
  :ref:`storage_config`.

Version 0.1.5
=============

*released on 14 May 2014*

- Introduced changelogs

- Many bugfixes

- Many doc fixes

- vdirsyncer now doesn't necessarily need UIDs anymore for synchronization.

- vdirsyncer now aborts if one collection got completely emptied between
  synchronizations. See :gh:`42`.
