[pair bob_contacts]

# synchronized. The definition of these storages follows in `[storage <name>]`
# blocks. This is similar to accounts in OfflineIMAP.

# If you want to synchronize several addressbooks, calendars etc that share
# the same storage location and differ only in a suffix to this location
# (i.e., a subdirectory) you can use collections. The comma-separated values
# in this parameter represent these subdirectories and are added as URL
# segments or similar.

# Together with the definition of the following two `[storage]` blocks below
# in this example it means that
#   - https://owncloud.example.com/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/bob/default/
#     will get synced with ~/.contacts/default/
#   - https://owncloud.example.com/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/bob/work/
#     will get synced with ~/.contacts/work/

# Omitting this parameter implies that the given path and URL in the
# corresponding `[storage <name>]` blocks are already pointing to a
# collection each.

# Optional: Specify a time range which should be synchronized. Either both
# start_date and end_date or neither have to be set. The default is to
# synchronize everything.  The following example synchronizes from one year in
# the past to one year in the future.

# All Python expressions are allowed here. The global namespace contains
# everything from the datetime module. The expression has to evaluate to a
# datetime.
