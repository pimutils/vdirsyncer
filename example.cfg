# synchronized. The definition of these storages follows in `[storage <name>]`

# collections are addressbooks, calendars etc to be synced. The comma-separated
# values in this parameter are representing subdirectories, are added as URL
# segment or similar.

# In this example, it means that
#   - https://owncloud.example.com/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/bob/default/
#     will get synced with ~/.contacts/default/
#   - https://owncloud.example.com/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/bob/work/
